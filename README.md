# 🎮 Algorand Coding Challenge: Fix The Bug 🐞!

## 🚩 Challenge 3: My AppClient is Broken! 😭
> I want to instantiate an app client to deploy and interact with my smart contract but it's not working!!

This project includes a simple `helloWorld` smart contract written with [TEALScript](https://tealscript.netlify.app/) inside of `./contract/helloWorld.algo.ts` file. The smart contract is already compiled with artifacts generated inside of the `./contracts/artifacts` folder and the application typed client inside of `./contracts/clients/helloWorldClient.ts` file. 

> Artifacts: autogenerated assets (TEAL contract code, ABI spec, source mapping) for your smart contract.
> Application Typed Client: autogenerated client used to easily deploy / interact with Algorand smart contract.

The `index.ts` file in the root level is a script that deploys the `helloWorld` smart contract and calls the `helloWorld` method.

However, if you try to run the `index.ts` file after going into the `challenge` directory, opening Docker Desktop, and then running:

```bash
algokit bootstrap all
algokit localnet start
npm run start
```
it will fail.

## Checkpoint 1: 🧰 Prerequisites 

1. [Install AlgoKit](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#install).
2. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). It is used to run a local Algorand network for development.
3. Install [Node.JS / npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) 

**Make sure to install these 3 prerequisites before continuing!**

Now you are ready to fix the bug!

## Checkpoint 3: 🐞 Fix the bug 🧐

1. Open Docker Desktop and launch Algorand localnet by running `algokit localnet start` in your terminal [For more info click me!](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/features/localnet.md#creating--starting-the-localnet). 
2. Go to `./contracts/helloWorld.algo.ts` to read the `helloWorld` TEALScript smart contract and understand what it does.
3. Go to `./index.ts` and read the comments on the file and fix the bug!
4. After fixing the bug run the below command inside the `challenge` directory: 
```bash
npm run start
```
If you see something like the image below, you have successfully fixed the bug! Congratulations 😆
